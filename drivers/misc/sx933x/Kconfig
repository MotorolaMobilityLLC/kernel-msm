config SENSORS_SX933X
    tristate "sx933x Programming Driver"
    help
      CapSense devices is the analog system contains the capacitive sensing
      hardware. Several hardware algorithms are supported. This hardware
      performs capacitive sensing and scanning without requiring external
      components. It contains internal flash memory, which have to be programmed
      with firmware using HSSP interface. Host Sourced Serial Programming (HSSP)
      refers to the programming of the target device on the board by using a host
      microcontroller. The PSoC 4 target is programmed through the SWD interface -
      ARM Serial Ware Debug. This option enables firmware programming driver and
      allows automatically identify device and matching firmware. See file
      Documentation/devicetree/bindings/misc/capsense_hssp.txt for details.
