	depends on SCSI && SCSI_DMA
	select PM_DEVFREQ
	select DEVFREQ_GOV_SIMPLE_ONDEMAND
	select NLS
	---help---
	This selects the support for UFS devices in Linux, say Y and make
	  sure that you know the name of your UFS host adapter (the card
	  inside your computer that "speaks" the UFS protocol, also
	  called UFS Host Controller), because you will be asked for it.
	  The module will be called ufshcd.

	  To compile this driver as a module, choose M here and read
	  <file:Documentation/scsi/ufs.txt>.
	  However, do not compile this as a module if your root file system
	  (the one containing the directory /) is located on a UFS device.
