menuconfig THERMAL
	tristate "Generic Thermal sysfs driver"
	help
	  Generic Thermal Sysfs driver offers a generic mechanism for
	  thermal management. Usually it's made up of one or more thermal
	  zone and cooling device.
	  Each thermal zone contains its own temperature, trip points,
	  cooling devices.
	  All platforms with ACPI thermal support can use this driver.
	  If you want this support, you should say Y or M here.

config THERMAL_HWMON
	bool
	depends on THERMAL
	depends on HWMON=y || HWMON=THERMAL
	default y

config THERMAL_MSM_POPMEM
	tristate "Qualcomm MSM POP memory temperature sensor"
	depends on THERMAL
	default n
	help
	  This enables a thermal sysfs driver for MSM POP memory. It shows up in
	  sysfs as a thermal zone with one trip point. Due to hardware
	  limitations, the temperatures are reported as "Low Temperature" (20 C)
	  "Normal Temperature" (50 C) and "Out of Spec High Temperature" (85 C).
	  This driver is designed to be used in conjunction with a user space
	  application to make all policy decisions.

config THERMAL_TSENS
	tristate "Qualcomm Tsens Temperature Alarm"
	depends on THERMAL
	default n
	help
	  This enables the thermal sysfs driver for the Tsens device. It shows
	  up in Sysfs as a thermal zone with mutiple trip points. Disabling the
	  thermal zone device via the mode file results in disabling the sensor.
	  Also able to set threshold temperature for both hot and cold and update
	  when a threshold is reached.

config SPEAR_THERMAL
	bool "SPEAr thermal sensor driver"
	depends on THERMAL
	depends on PLAT_SPEAR
	help
	  Enable this to plug the SPEAr thermal sensor driver into the Linux
	  thermal framework
