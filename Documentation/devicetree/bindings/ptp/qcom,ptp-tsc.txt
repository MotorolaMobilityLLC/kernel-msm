* Qualcomm Technologies, Inc. Timestamp Counter(TSC) based PTP clock

TSC module is a timestamp generator, which runs a 64 bit counter for
system timekeeping.
ETU is event timestamp module, which captures the timestamp from TSC
and global counter bus for a given event. The event is selected from
a set of GPIOs and SW triggered events. The design is parameterized
to detect multiple events, using different “slices”.
One slice is used for every event.

Required properties:
- compatible: should contain the compatibility string.
                 "qcom,tsc"
- reg: address and length of the TSC registers.
	Address and length of the ETU registers(optional).
- reg-names: must contain "tsc", "etu" (optional).
- clocks: list of clock phandles required to access TSC/ETU.
- clock-names: list of clock names for the above clock phandles.
- assigned-clocks: clock phandles to assign clock rates.
- assigned-clock-rates: clock rates in HZ.

Optional properties:
- qcom,tsc-nsec-update: boolean property to indicate the TSC counters
			have values in nanoseconds, rather than in secs
			and nanoseconds.
- qcom,etu-event-sel: array of ETU slice numbers.
- qcom,etu-event-names: ETU slice names for the corresponding
			event slice numbers.
- interrupts: interrupt numbers associated with the ETU slice.
- interrupt-names: names corresponding to the above interrupt numbers.
- pinctrl-<#> : pinctrl configurations
- pinctrl-names: pinctrl names

Example:

        tsc@1da0000 {
                compatible = "qcom,tsc";
                reg = <0x1da0000 0x2000>, <0x01db0000 0x10000>;
                reg-names = "tsc", "etu";

                clocks = <&gcc GCC_TSC_CFG_AHB_CLK>, <&gcc GCC_TSC_CNTR_CLK >,
                       <&gcc GCC_TSC_ETU_CLK>;
                clock-names = "cfg_ahb", "cntr", "etu";
                assigned-clocks = <&gcc GCC_TSC_CNTR_CLK>, <&gcc GCC_TSC_ETU_CLK>;
                assigned-clock-rates = <500000000> , <500000000>;

		qcom,etu-event-sel = <1 3>;
		qcom,etu-event-names = "gps_pps", "tod_pps";

	        interrupts = <GIC_SPI 331 IRQ_TYPE_EDGE_RISING>,
                             <GIC_SPI 329 IRQ_TYPE_EDGE_RISING>;
                interrupt-names = "tod_pps", "gps_pps";

		pinctrl-names = "default";
		pinctrl-0 = <&etu_tod_pps_active>, <&etu_gps_pps_active>;
        };
